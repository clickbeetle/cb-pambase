This repository contains the PAM configuration base for Gentoo Linux
and Gentoo FreeBSD, this mostly means the system-auth and system-login
configuration file that provides the basic support for generical
authentication for services, and console login (on tty or on various
desktop managers).

The Makefile manages the choice of optional features that will be
enabled in the final file.
